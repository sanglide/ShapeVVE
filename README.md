# ShapeVVE: Variable Evaluator for Multivariate Time Series Shapelets Extraction

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "ShapeVVE: Variable Evaluator for multivariate time series shapelets extraction".

## Description
This repository provides code for evaluating the utility of shapelets in time series classification tasks. 

üîç **Enhancing Interpretability in Time Series Classification via High-Value Shapelets**  

This repository explores the value of **shapelets** to improve the interpretability of time series classification while maintaining competitive accuracy. By identifying and utilizing **high-value shapelets**, we aim to enhance model efficiency and provide meaningful insights into decision-making processes.  

‚ú® **Key Features:**  
- **Shapelet Value Assessment**: Evaluates shapelets based on their discriminative power and interpretability.  
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Uses high-value shapelets for classification without sacrificing accuracy.  
- **Interpretability Enhancement**: Investigates how **dimensionality selection** of shapelets contributes to clearer model explanations.  

üìä **Applications:** Suitable for time series analysis tasks where both **performance** and **human-understandable explanations** are crucial.  

Contributions and feedback are welcome! üöÄ
